# hello-world
just a test

## Now working on branch joking

# Now let's use the command line (this gui sucks)
As a first example we start from an existing project. In github terminology we clone a repository.
It is as simple as that
```
git clone git@github.com:galadino/hello-world.git
```
If you add your ssh key from the web interface, this will go smooth with no password request.
This is done from the 'SSH and GPG keys' entry from the 'setting' menu from your profile icon.

Now we go tthis new dir and make some edits to the README.md file and then commit this changes.
